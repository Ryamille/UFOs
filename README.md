# UFOs

## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this challenge was to be able to take the UFO sighting data and make a useable app to filter the data. JavaScript was used to allow the webpage to be able to use the filters correctly. Then we used a css to sytlize the homepage to make it look a little cleaner.

## Results
When you scroll down a little you will see on the left a fully functional filter search bar. In it you can see datetime, city, state, country, and shape.
Putting a correct input into one of the criteria will allow the data to filter alomst immediatley.

The filter bar also allows multiple filters to be used at once.

## Summary
The biggest drawback to this design is when you have to filter multiple searcher options in search it does not have an autofill feature to easily combine two or more filters together. Say if a state was typed in when the city box is clicked on it should give all the option the data has available.

To improve the webpage a count of all the hits your filter received should be include. As of right now the only way would be to manually count them out.
Another simple way to improve the filter bar would be to include a feature that helps with the case sensitivity. Unfortunely when any of the criterias are typed incorrectly not only will it not work but it also does not have any way to show mistypes
